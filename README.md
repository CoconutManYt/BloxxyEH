## Introduction

Bloxxy is the first and only publicly available [Emergency Hamburg](https://www.roblox.com/games/7711635737/Emergency-Hamburg) **external** auto farm tool. It is not bannable and not considered cheating as it works like a macro.

## Features

- **Coverage** : Auto farm any robbery available in the game.
- **Personal** : Advanced customisation.
- **Optimised** : No lag or frame drops.
- **Bokkmark Servers** : Put server codes and it will automaticly generate a link, just click the "Join" button and you will be connected into the server.
- **Privacy and Security** : Doesn't store any player info, all settings are saved locally.

## Requirements

There are no particular requirements to install Bloxxy. In game you do need to buy the bombs/tools yourself as the auto buy feature is still a W.I.P

## Installation

Choose the latest release and open the downloaded exe file, it will automaticly install the main app and will launch it automaticly.

## Roadmap

We are currently planning new features some of these include:

- ~~User Interface~~
- ~~Keybind System~~
- ~~Safe Robbery~~
- Bank Robbery
- Jewelery Robbery
- Auto Buy
- AFK farm all
